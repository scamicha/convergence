The authors have included a very nice, detailed description of the difficulties in measuring Reynolds stresses
in their response, but have neglected to include the discussion in the text. The authors should add at least
an abbreviated description (perhaps in section 3.4 where they have described the accretion rate
calculation). Numerous other papers have measured Reynolds stresses, and thus potential problems with the
measurement are worth pointing out. Including these details increases the credibility of the statement that
this term can be left out.

* The main points of this discussion are now included in section 3.4.

The only other change I suggest is related to the discussion of the Meru & Bate result (page 22). The recent
paper by Paardekooper et al 2011 (MNRAS Letters, 416) demonstrates convincingly that the issue was numerical
in nature. A citation to this paper would be appropriate.

* These changes have been made

The paper that the authors could not find had the last name misspelled, I apologize. It is Walch et al 2010
(MNRAS, 402, pp 2253).

* This citation has been added

As a very minor note, there are a few places where \alpha_{\rm eff} and \t_{\rm cool} are used without the
\rm.

* The instances of this subscript have been normalized. 

With the above changes made, I think the paper is suitable for publication.
